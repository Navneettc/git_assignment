g. What is the main branch?
The main branch in git is the branch you can clone to work on projects. It serves as the default branch for the respository you are working on. It is where the production ready code belongs and all the other branches are where the test or experiemental code is created.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
No, create a new branch and pull request to allow for differences to be tracked and approved. Pushing changes to the main branch will change the production ready code without review.
